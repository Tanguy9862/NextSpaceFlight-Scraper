# Space Exploration App

## Overview

Space Exploration App is a Python-based Dash application designed to provide real-time insights into space exploration. The application is deployed on a web server and updates its data daily through web scraping techniques. It offers a comprehensive view of space activities, from historical milestones to upcoming launches. The design is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.

## Features

### Home Page

- **3D Earth Globe**: A rotating 3D globe that visualizes the number of space launches by country since the beginning of space exploration.

### Historical Events Page

- **Cytoscape Graph**: A constellation-like graph that represents significant historical events in space exploration. Clicking on a node reveals a description and an image related to the event.

### Space Dashboard

- **Line Plot**: Displays the number of launches per year, with the ability to filter by success or failure.
- **Histogram**: Shows launches by month, which updates based on the selected year from the line plot.
- **Sunburst Chart**: Represents hierarchical data starting from countries, to organizations, to success/failure rates.
- **Upcoming Launch Info**: A section that provides details about the next upcoming launch.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backend is entirely written in Python.
- **Dash**: Used for creating the web application.
- **Web Scraping**: Data is scraped from various sources using Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. The scraping scripts are hosted in separate repositories:
  - [Wikipedia Space Scraper](https://github.com/Tanguy9862/Wikipedia_Space_Scraper)
  - [Next Launch Scraper](https://github.com/Tanguy9862/Next-Launch-Scraper)
  - [NextSpaceFlight Scraper](https://github.com/Tanguy9862/NextSpaceFlight-Scrapper)
- **Data Management**: Scraping scripts are packaged as reusable Python modules.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Dash components and Plotly for interactive visualizations.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be fully responsive.
